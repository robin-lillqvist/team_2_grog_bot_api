### Ground Rules
This team has a set of ground rules for our project process.
##### Code review checklist
Before submitting a PR for review we will conduct an internal review made by the opposite pair programming team. They will make sure to double check the following:
* Code formatting
* Naming standards
* Functionality for each line of code
* Test coverage
#### Naming
This team will be using snake case for naming branches. Both sides (API and client) will have the same branch names for each feature.
#### Communication
This team aim to have three join ups a day:
* 08:45, Team scrum | Setting the plan for the day, preparing scrum master for joined morning scrum
* before lunch, check in | Making sure we are on the right track and moving forward
* 16:45, Team scrum | Going through the daily progress, making sure we are moving forward
#### Pair programming
This team aims to work in two sub-teams where each team follow the same user story on both api and client. This way we can easily understand what the other team is doing and both sides and can help each other out with our features.
